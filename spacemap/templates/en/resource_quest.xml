 <item name="quest_description_512058"><![CDATA[Hey now, have you heard about the re-issue of the Yamato?

 <item name="quest_title_512062"><![CDATA[Prototypical]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_512062"><![CDATA[How are you liking our Expo so far? Oh, good! Now, please excuse me for a little while: there's a prototype model being unveiled in Hall C in a few minutes, and I just have to see it. Luna Industries and Titan Tech have been in a bit of an arms race trying to develop a new kind of battlecruiser...]]></item>
 <item name="quest_title_512063"><![CDATA[Cutting Edge]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_512063"><![CDATA[The prototype was all right, but really, it's the new Titan Technologies cruise control that's going to dominate the next few years, if you ask me. Responsive, defensive, intelligent automatic flying that lets pilots concentrate on their weapons? Amazing stuff.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_512064"><![CDATA[Did you see his entourage? Ha ha! Yeah, there are a bunch of them at the Expo - petty lords of their little outposts, on asteroids and planets no-one's ever heard of. No taste, no class, no know-how, no ingenuity - all they got is money, so we're here to help 'em spend it, right?]]></item>
 <item name="quest_title_512065"><![CDATA[New Clients]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_512065"><![CDATA[Say, maybe you could help me out with something. You see, my bosses in the Expo Steering Committee have been chasing these backwater billionaires' Credits for months, but it's like herding cats. They've finally caught their interest by promising a big alien hunt in our newest ships.]]></item> 
 <item name="quest_title_512066"><![CDATA[Big Fish On the Line]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_512066"><![CDATA[I was hoping you'd help me out. See, my bosses want to stage a demonstration first, in a normal ship - show these billionaires what a really good pilot can do with existing hardware, and shoot down a lot of flashy aliens. Kristallons, say. You can handle those, right?]]></item> 
 <item name="quest_title_512067"><![CDATA[Ghost Flying]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_512067"><![CDATA[Our nano-cams captured it all - you were very impressive! The billionaires have agreed to try out our state-of-the-art models... Um, but a lot of them come from rough outposts with a go-big-or-go-home mentality, right? So, well, they've got their sights set on some pretty big game. They want to go after Cubicons. And, um, Battlerays. If you could help them out, there's no need for them to know it wasn't exactly all their laser fire that brought down the big guys, right?]]></item>

Follow enemy Goliath ships and steal their cargo boxes to ensure that our raw materials remain sufficient - that's the only way we can make sure we stay on top! Use your cloaking device so enemy ships can't detect you. Then report back home. Godspeed, pilot!]]></item>

The faster you are, the higher your score will be.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_45"><![CDATA[A challenge that will test how quick and agile a pilot you are. Visit an enemy X-1 map and shoot down 100 Streuners. Again, the time needed to complete the job will determine your score in the end.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_46"><![CDATA[So, you wanna save the universe .... then start out by collecting 20 Prometium - you know, the little red things found floating around X-1 and X-2. Once you've collected the Prometium, bring it back to the space station to sell.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_47"><![CDATA[We need more Prometium! Much more ... start looking and collect 40 Prometium for us.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_48"><![CDATA[If you bring us enough Prometium again, we'll be able to complete the first part of our research. 80 sounds like a lot, but we're in dire need of large quantities.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_49"><![CDATA[We could make good use of the raw materials still floating around enemy territory. Collect 200 Prometium there in 100 minutes.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_50"><![CDATA[Make yourself useful and collect 30 Endurium for me. You'll find the small blue rocks floating around X-1 and X-2. Trust me, it'll be worth your time!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_51"><![CDATA[We still don't have enough. You must collect more Endurium so that we can continue our research. 60 Endurium shouldn't be any problem for you.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_52"><![CDATA[Our research finally seems to be paying off. But we we still need more Endurium. Get 120 Endurium for us. We're counting on you!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_53"><![CDATA[Deep in space, you'll find large quantities of Terbium: a golden ore which can be found floating around X-3 and X-4. We need these space rocks for research purposes. Power up your ship's engines and bring us 40 Terbium quickly. Keep an eye out for Lordakians and Mordons!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_54"><![CDATA[Terbium has helped speed up our research enormously. However, there are still many mysteries to uncover ... it's a very strange substance. We need more Terbium for research. 80 should be enough.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_55"><![CDATA[This new substance seems to be very unstable. For the very first time ever, we were able to briefly create a subspace portal in the lab. If you collect another 160 Terbium, we'll be able to hold open the subspace portal long enough to go to the other side. Just keep up your guard, you never know what could travel to our side from the other side. I guess, we'll just have to risk it!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_56"><![CDATA[Those pesky Streuners keep interfering with our work. Destroy 5 of them to scare them off. Make sure you're carrying enough laser ammo and rockets on board!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_57"><![CDATA[There are still way too many Streuners ... they're turning into a real pain. Shoot down another 10 of them.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_58"><![CDATA[The Streuners are getting harder to hold back, but we have to keep trying! Destroy 20 of them to keep them at bay. Lucky for us, they haven't been all that aggressive ... yet.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_59"><![CDATA[Two days ago, we lost radar contact with the research probe XF3LD in the X-2 sector just seconds after it made first contact with a new race: The Lordakians. We still don't know why they responded so aggressively, but that's beside the point. If you want to help, seek and destroy 10 of those creatures! If you do, I'll give you a good recommendation the next time you're up for promotion.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_60"><![CDATA[We've analyzed the last pictures taken from our research probe XF3LD. The Lordakians seem to be regrouping. Destroy 20 of them before they cause any further damage in our sectors.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_61"><![CDATA[There's no viable explanation, but the Lordakians have started attacking our sectors. That's bad news for us. Maybe if we launch a counterattack, things will settle down. Destroy 40 Lordakians.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_62"><![CDATA[For some time now, the sector 2RR0D0G-UV3 around Planet Terra has been under attack by aliens. Our scouts assume the Mordons are behind these attacks. It's time to take action: Destroy 10 Mordons on X-3 or X-4!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_63"><![CDATA[Unfortunately our last offensive didn't have much of an effect. It just made the Mordons more aggressive. If they lose another 20 of their battle robots, they might learn to respect us. So do your best!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_64"><![CDATA[The Mordons are up to something. We can't afford to stand around and do nothing. One last attack against the Mordons and we'll at least have bought ourselves some time ... destroy 40 Mordons!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_65"><![CDATA[Red alert! Devolarians are attacking the colonies in the X-3 sectors. If you're loyal to your company, then help them eliminate this threat. Search out and destroy 3 Devolarians on the X-3 maps.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_66"><![CDATA[It's a complete mystery why the Devolarians decided to start attacking us. They usually stay in their own sectors and fight the Sibelonauts. Just recently they turned their attention to the three companies. Whatever they're up to, we can't let up now. If you take over six of them, their forces will be greatly weakened.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_67"><![CDATA[The Devolarians have been weakened, but their fleet seems to be recovering quickly. What could they possibly want from us? They haven't meddled with us for over 200 years. It's up to you to defeat 12 Devolarians!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_68"><![CDATA[We haven't heard much from the Sibelons since the last intergalactic war, but now they've started to retaliate. Several motherships are on a path of destruction in sector X-4. Destroy 2 of them. Recruit some help first, or else you won't stand a chance.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_69"><![CDATA[We can't get the Sibelons under control. Their shields are much too strong for our weapons. We need more samples of debris ... blast 4 Sibelons into spacedust! Recruit the best pilots you know; you're gonna need all the help you can get.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_70"><![CDATA[We're slowly beginning to understand their shield technology. With a bit of luck, we'll be able to use this technology for our own ships. Our lab readings show that the Sibelons have been scanning our space station, concentrating mainly on our labs. The newly discovered substance seems to make them very nervous. Whatever they're planning, they must not succeed! Annihilate 8 Sibelons.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_72"><![CDATA[Saimonites: Bounty hunters of the universe. Wherever there's war and money, the Saimonites are bound to be there. They're very aggressive and fast, but then again, so are you. Aren't you? Destroy 20 Saimonites on the X-3 and X-4 maps!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_73"><![CDATA[We simply can't allow the Saimonites to keep getting in our way. You've got to do something! As long as there's no Saimonite mothership on our radar, we can still control the situation. Destroy 40 Saimonites!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_74"><![CDATA[Who hired the Saimonites? Someone seems to be very interested in keeping us busy. We'll find out who's behind this, but until then the only thing that will help is to put up a good fight. Destroy 80 Saimonites!]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_413001_mmo"><![CDATA[Report! The drone's destroyed? Yeah, that's probably for the best - we've got enough problems with powerful, un-ID'd ships attacking our colonies. R&D thinks they could be the result of the Kristallin experiments they spotted. They're cloaked somehow, which is why our scanners can't get a clean read on 'em. I don't give a damn who or what they are: if it's a fight with Mars they want, it's a solid beating they'll get! And if EIC provokes us again, there'll be war - I'll bet my pay on it!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_413001_eic"><![CDATA[Report! The drone is destroyed? Hmm, a shame, but perhaps it's for the best: we have a new threat to address. Unidentified, over-powered ships are attacking our new colonies, and our scanners can't make head or tail of them - it seems they, too, are cloaked somehow. R&D suspects that they are the result of Kristallin experiments - but whomever they may be, if it's war with Earth they want, then war they shall have. Them, and VRU, as well, if it dares provoke us again. Mark my words.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_413001_vru"><![CDATA[Tell me! Where's the drone? ...Destroyed? Drat. We'll have to be more careful next time. Might be for the best, though: we need to focus on the strange ships that have been attacking our colonies. Our scanner readings are very unclear; I hypothesize that they're using cloaking devices. Be careful: our XBS team thinks they're the result of the previously observed Kristallin experiments. You know the drill: live specimens are preferred! ...Which won't be the case for MMO, if they provoke us again.]]></item>

Dr. Stein, supposedly a specialist in this sort of touchy-feely crap, met with the Kristallon to reassure them that our attacks were just a misunderstanding. But during the talks, someone on his team planted a bomb and blew the whole negotiation sky-high! Now the Kristallon are pissed...]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_114002_eic"><![CDATA[So much for diplomacy. Dr. Al-Hazen, one of our top negotiators, was in the middle of talks with the Kristallon - trying to reassure them that our hostilities were a simple misunderstanding - when the conference vessel was bombed. The Kristallon have declared it proof that humanity's not to be trusted.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_114002_vru"><![CDATA[Oh no! Dr. Brown, one of our best xeno-diplomacy specialists, was in the middle of negotiations with the Kristallon - in an attempt to convince them that any shots fired were just a misunderstanding, you see - when the talks were bombed!

 <item name="quest_description_114004_eic"><![CDATA[Dr. Al-Hazen - an Uber-Streuner? How?? He planted that bomb to force us into a war with the Kristallon. I'd wager this is VRU's doing, somehow.

 <item name="quest_description_114016_eic"><![CDATA[This is... New. A scout has discovered a gigantic cube - a Cubikon of some sort, the size of a mothership. Our pilot had barely opened fire before he was attacked by small hunting droids that the ever-creative pencil-necks at R&D have labelled "Protegit" - and we've heard nothing since. Investigate this.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_114016_vru"><![CDATA[Oh, my! One of our lucky scouts discovered a huge new type of Cubikon - mothership-sized! He had barely initiated capture protocols before it sent out dozens of small hunting droids - hmm. I suppose he wasn't so lucky, at that.

Here's where you come in. We aren't going to wait until they have their asses in gear to strike first! I can trust only the most daredevil pilots, like my Hornets, to fly right into enemy territory to drop mines.

At last, we're going to make those brutes at both MMO and VRU pay for their endless, flagrant insults! Our first waves of fighters are already underway; I'm trusting my Scorpions with a different task, to weaken the enemy by stinging hard behind the front lines. Drop mines in their territory, and then protect our tech harvesting team from the Protegits as we try and capture that Cubikon: using its tech may prove the key to a swift victory!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_414001_vru"><![CDATA[It's been a long time coming... We're at war! The Inner Circle has made the official declaration.

 <item name="quest_description_415001_mmo"><![CDATA[Damn! We've been on the wrong track altogether. The tracker on those drones comes from the other side of the Gate! Someone, or something, is lurking back there - our recon drones' images of a ship are hellishly distorted by interference, and our best engineers are stumped by its silhouette. They can't even make a start at identifying it. Hornets, I need some daredevils to do something truly dumb: jump through that Gate and find out who's there! Up for it?]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_415001_eic"><![CDATA[Blast. We've been barking up the wrong tree entirely. The transmitter beacon on those drones comes from the sector behind the Gate! Someone, or something, is lurking back there... Our recon drones captured images of a ship, but they're hopelessly distorted from unidentified interference. Our best engineers are completely unable to identify its silhouette. Scorpions! I need skilful pilots for a truly fearless assignment: jump through that Gate and learn who's there! What say you?]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_415001_vru"><![CDATA[We've been peering down the wrong microscope altogether! That tracking device planted on the drone came from the other side of the Gate, not this one! We sent recon drones, of course, but unidentified interference distorted most of the images. The one clear ship silhouette it captured has all our xeno specialists scratching their heads... All right, Cobras! Feel like a little exploratory mission? Jump through that Gate to identify who or what is behind it. For science!]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116001_mmo"><![CDATA[Those marauders appeared from behind the Gate and were gone before we knew it. Weird. Never mind. We have better things to do than chase interstellar crooks around - Kristallon and Kristallin are bashing each others' crystal skulls in, which I wouldn't give two turds about if they weren't doing it on our turf.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116001_eic"><![CDATA[Those marauders came out from behind the Gate, caused a mess, and then turned tail... How odd. If we didn't have more pressing matters, I'd look into it now, but we have Kristallon and Kristallin fighting - as usual - and their conflict has spilled over into our territory. Unacceptable.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116001_vru"><![CDATA[Did you learn anything about those marauders who came out from that Gate? No? Shame... Well, I'm sure we'll have more chances to study them. Either way, there's no chance of being bored here and now: the Kristallon and Kristallin have brought their usual bickering through our borders. This has to stop!]]></item>

Don't you feel lucky? ...I don't care. I just don't want them struttin' around my sky like precious little EIC dandies, acting like they own the place! Take care of it.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116002_eic"><![CDATA[The continuing war against the other Corporations requires our full attention, and we don't have the troops to spare to handle a crytalloid incursion. I won't have those arrogant aliens swanning about our space as though they were obstreperous VRU buffoons, sticking their noses in where they aren't wanted.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116002_vru"><![CDATA[The Kristallon may have raised various civilizations up from barbarism long ago, but these days they - and their destructive brothers - are too big a threat to ignore. VRU's Security Circle is up to its neck in the war effort and can't spare any troops to deal with the Kristallin, so that's up to you all, Cobras!]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116003_mmo"><![CDATA[Good job out there. Our troops have been winning almost every conflict they've been in! Partly because they know their flanks are guarded. There'll be no bug attacks from the rear while the Hornets are on patrol! I feel like we can take anything on... Let's limber up on some nice, big targets.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116003_eic"><![CDATA[Excellent. Our troops are prevailing against our foes on nearly every front! We must continue to act as rear guard - the course of the war depends upon it. We're doing admirably, and I feel as though we could take on all comers. Let's begin with some large targets - Devolarium.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116003_vru"><![CDATA[Truth triumphant! Our fleets are pushing MMO and EIC forces back at almost every turn! They're encountering tremendous resistance, though - if they're going to keep it up, we need to be their rear guard against any possible xeno attacks. A preemptive strike on the Devolarium would be a good start!]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116004_mmo"><![CDATA[Our troops at the front lines have suffered some setbacks. Some sneaky VRU pilots flanked them and destroyed an outpost, which is attracting some heavily armed Mordon. Doesn't matter how big they get - they're all junk scavengers and scrap merchants at heart...]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116004_eic"><![CDATA[This is no good. MMO managed to outflank our troops and destroy a significant outpost. A small fleet of well-armed Mordon is rapidly approaching the wreckage... I suppose that, no matter how advanced they get, at heart they are still scrap collectors and scavengers.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116004_vru"><![CDATA[We've lost a vital outpost! EIC's strategists are nothing to sneeze at! This is terrible... And now, the floating wreckage is attracting Mordon. Old habits die hard for those xenos: no matter how powerful they become, they remain junk dealers and scrap scavengers at their core.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116005_mmo"><![CDATA[Major attacks near Titan - our brave troops are holding the line, but just by the skin of their teeth. Now, scouts report a marauder incursion, all the way into Jupiter's orbit. I'll keep an eye on them; you deal with any aliens who think they can spread into our solar system with impunity!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116005_eic"><![CDATA[There's a significant increase in hostilities near Titan, along with reports of marauders gathering in Jupiter's orbit. The Mordon look to be steering clear - not so the Sibelon, unfortunately. Our heroic troops are standing their ground despite heavy losses, but we desperately need some breathing room.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116005_vru"><![CDATA[Fierce fighting around Titan - and marauders spotted in Jupiter's orbit! Our troops are holding position as gamely as they can, but things are looking a little grim... We desperately need a firebreak and some breathing room. You'll have to deal with the Sibelon hanging around here without backup, I'm afraid.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_title_116006"><![CDATA[Jolly Rogers]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116006_mmo"><![CDATA[Damn. We're gonna have to ignore the bugs for now: marauders are proving to be a much bigger problem. They're armed to the teeth, and vicious - they've taken no prisoners and left only corpses. Our SecForce troops were weakened by their last battles, and need our help to stand against these lunatics!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116006_eic"><![CDATA[New orders, Scorpions: our highest priority is now the marauders! Their ships are well-armed, and when they attack, they leave no survivors. Our forces have been weakened by our military losses, and could use help from our best pilots. Look out: these marauders are vicious beyond belief.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116006_vru"><![CDATA[Oh no - forget the xenos! The marauders screamed out of their Jupiter orbit and crashed head-on into our weakened Security Circle forces! They need support from qualified, elite pilots, or there's no way they'll stand against these troglodytes! Watch out: the marauders take no prisoners, and fight brutally.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_title_116007"><![CDATA[Pike in the Koi Pond]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116007_mmo"><![CDATA[These marauder scum spread like the plague. Some sectors are already completely under their thumb - but I'm sure the Board's overreacting. "The deadliest threat of our time"? I think not. A few loudmouth curs who'll fly away at the first kick, you'll see. We'll run 'em off within a month!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116007_eic"><![CDATA[I'll grant you the marauders are dangerous, spread like a pox, and control several sectors already, but nevertheless I think that our High Command is overreacting. "The deadliest threat of our time"? Hyperbole. A few verminous pirates, more bark than bite. We'll have them all trounced within the month, you'll see!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116007_vru"><![CDATA[The Inner Circle must be working from inconclusive data. Marauders, the "deadliest threat of our time", moreso than the Sibelon? Over-magnification of the issue. They may spread quickly and dominate a few sectors, but that's the sort of challenge that spices life up! We'll be rid of them within the month, I'm sure.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116008_mmo"><![CDATA[Don't give me that look. How was I to know the marauders wouldn't be the pushovers we thought they would? They're smart, their tech is advanced, and they work well together, flying in tight formation and guarding each others' backs. Stay on the move... They're responding to our presence with marked hostility.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116008_eic"><![CDATA[Belay that look, there. No-one could have guessed the marauders would prove any more than crude barbarians! Instead, we find them to be cunning strategists, death-defying pilots and formation flyers, armed with advanced technology. They're not overly fond of us, either. Be careful and stay on the move.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116008_vru"><![CDATA[I don't blame you for the side-eye, there - I was wrong! The marauders are a lot more dangerous than simple bandits. They're fast, skilled pilots with a lot of experience, clever tactics, and more than the usual amount of aggression - and their technology is truly enviable! Be careful out there.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116009_mmo"><![CDATA[The marauders are fielding some impressive ships, and they're ripping holes in our ranks. I hate to say it, but we can't take this kind of punishment for long. Our SecForce troops are feeling battered - support them, so they don't lose heart!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116009_eic"><![CDATA[I hate to say it, but we may have bitten off more than we can chew. The marauders' ships are leaving gaping holes in our ranks, and troop morale is plummeting. We can't take this sort of punishment for too long... Get out there and lend what aid you can!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116009_vru"><![CDATA[Our ranks will break if they take many more hits from those huge marauder ships! We can't fight them off as well as both MMO and EIC! Morale is falling in every Circle. Cobras, you need to buy us some breathing room until we can figure out a solution!]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116010_mmo"><![CDATA[Wait, what are those marauders doing with that Cubikon...? They can't be - damn, Protegit incoming! Ugh, those stupid cubes can't tell different humans apart! They've been driven right smack to the middle of our troops, and are attacking in every direction. Get them out of there.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116010_eic"><![CDATA[Either my eyes are deceiving me, or we have quite a few Protegit inbound. ...Those marauders are clever! They fired on a Cubikon, triggering its self-defense measures - but those blasted cubes can't tell the difference between one human ship and another! They're wreaking havoc, and must be stopped.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116010_vru"><![CDATA[Oh, clever, clever. The marauders bombarded a Cubikon and then led its little protectors right in the midst of our troops. Protegit, naturally, can't tell the difference between human factions - or don't care - and are attacking everyone. Do something to dispel them as quickly as possible!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_title_116011"><![CDATA[Thaw]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116011_mmo"><![CDATA[The Board has started peace talks with EIC and VRU envoys; they say we need to make common cause against the greater marauder threat. Cowards! I mean, yes, MMO's suffered a setback or two, but we're strong enough to survive and win out over anything, right? I SAID, "right?" ...Damn straight, I'm right.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116011_eic"><![CDATA[Our Managing Directors want to sue for peace from MMO and VRU and make common cause against the "greater marauder threat" - it goes against every EIC principle! It may boost troop morale temporarily, but EIC is strong enough to address any threat that arises! Unless you believe otherwise...? Good. I thought not.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116011_vru"><![CDATA[Peace talks with EIC and MMO? How can the Inner Circle justify negotiating with blasphemers who twist and manipulate scientific facts for their own ends, and deny the Truth! This may boost troop morale temporarily, but logic dictates there must be other ways to win! Do you agree? Of course you do. It is Truth.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116012_mmo"><![CDATA[No end to these idiotic peace talks is in sight... When diplomats and civilians hold the reins, no good can come of it. There's no negotiating with those EIC fops and VRU freaks - might as well try and talk sense to a Sibelon. Meanwhile, those marauders are widening their reach every day...]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116012_eic"><![CDATA[Diplomats and civilians... Give weaklings power, and witness your entire society domesticated! The peace talks, to my utter lack of shock, drag on interminably - we're as likely to tame a Sibelon as we are to reach an accord with those MMO boors and VRU tentacle-bait. And all the while, the marauder threat grows.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116012_vru"><![CDATA[It's awful how many precious resources are being squandered on these pointless peace talks! We might as well try to make peace with the Sibelon as with those pompous EIC and MMO thugs. Meanwhile, marauders plunder their way through our territory, and only we Cobras to stand against them!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_title_116013"><![CDATA[A Daring Raid]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116013_mmo"><![CDATA[Finally! The Board's approved another raid into marauder territory. This time we'll be prepared - only the best of the best are coming along. Let's prove to the wimps on the Board that MMO needs no help - and certainly not from EIC or VRU - to win out against its enemies!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116013_eic"><![CDATA[Fortunately, some of High Command still has its priorities straight: we have permission to raid into marauder-occupied territory again. No mistakes! Only the best of the Scorpions are permitted to apply. We'll prove to the Managing Directors that EIC needs help from neither MMO nor VRU to keep its house in order!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116013_vru"><![CDATA[Phew! Looks like irrationality hasn't completely overtaken the Inner Circle: we have a directive to mount a raid into marauder territory. Only the most elite Cobras will be eligible: there can be no mistakes. We will prove to the rest of the Circle that VRU doesn't need MMO or EIC to protect itself!]]></item>

You know, we've never actually seen a marauder's corpse... I wonder what kind of disgusting bug hides in those ship's hulls? Crack one open, and let's take a look!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116014_eic"><![CDATA[The marauders are challenging adversaries - the raid may not have been an comprehensive victory, but I posit that they won't forget us in a hurry. I wonder... To date, we've not yet seen what sort of revolting alien interloper hides within these marauders' ships. Let's find out - crack one open!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116014_vru"><![CDATA[The marauders are formidable opponents - the raid may not have been an unequivocal victory, but we made a good showing. And one thing's clear: we need more data about the marauders! We don't even know what they look like... and I'm so curious! See if you can't catch me a live specimen.]]></item>

The peace talks aren't meeting with any success, either - and I don't understand why we're still having them. Cuper's Ashes, the endless, pointless yapping wastes so much time... It makes me so mad, and there's nothing I can do about it!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116015_eic"><![CDATA[They're rather tough nuts to crack, aren't they? Don't lose heart; there are plenty of them left to run through the nutcracker. The peace talks?

 <item name="quest_description_116016_eic"><![CDATA[Scorpions! My direct superiors and I agree: it's past time to subvert the peace talks, as we all know they'll reach no resolution. Discretion is paramount here, but should any Managing Directors protest, you will suffer no consequences. Destroy the fleet of MMO heavy cruisers threatening to cross our borders.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116016_vru"><![CDATA[Good news! MMO's heavy cruisers that have been patrolling our borders so provocatively have caused my direct superiors to order it taken down, as discreetly as possible.

Look how closely together they're flying: they're nervous about an attack. Why not sow a little chaos in their ranks? Their pilots have such itchy trigger fingers that they're likely to shoot each other down!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_title_116018"><![CDATA[The VRU Dispute]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116018_mmo"><![CDATA[Good work; EIC's less of a threat now, unlike VRU. Their flying is overly cautious, which I can tell from here: those poor dorks don't know their ships' bows from their sterns unless they're remotely controlling them. Pathetic - and no challenge at all for you, I'll bet.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116018_eic"><![CDATA[Well done! Do you feel up to the challenge of VRU's cruisers, as well? They certainly don't pose the threat that the MMO cruisers did - but what can one expect from anxious, namby-pamby pilots who crawled out of test tubes?

 <item name="quest_description_116019_eic"><![CDATA[Just as I predicted: the peace talks are falling irrevocably apart.

 <item name="quest_description_116019_vru"><![CDATA[Hah! The peace talks are finally falling apart... About time. The Inner Circle is pushing for an "unofficial truce" to relieve the pressure on our harried troops. Hm.

 <item name="quest_title_116020"><![CDATA[Down With EIC!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_116020_mmo"><![CDATA[I was right all along: the peace talks are falling completely apart.

The answer is always "fire at will". Obviously.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_116023_eic"><![CDATA[Arms, ships, and troops need power and pay; Galaxy Gates require palladium. The tides of war will turn against us if our supply lines are broken.

 <item name="quest_description_116023_vru"><![CDATA[War is always pricier than planned, in ore as well as in troops and materiel; our research budget could even start to suffer soon!

 <item name="quest_description_116025_eic"><![CDATA[The marauders again! They sold our convoy's position to the Kristallon, who are on their way to try and loot it.

 <item name="quest_description_116025_vru"><![CDATA[Ugh! The marauders are back to muddy the waters: they betrayed our freighter and ore convoy's position to the Kristallon, who are coming in to try and loot it.

They wanted to take our ore? Cute. Let's show them how it's done - MMO's roots are in pirate mining, and we haven't forgotten. If you succeed, it might finally convince the Board that we don't need to fear anything space can throw at us: marauders, human Corporations, bugs of any stripe, or any other threat we haven't met yet! Destroy as many enemy ships as possible!]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_416001_eic"><![CDATA[I'm relieved that those absurd calls for peace have been definitively silenced. Right. This marauder problem is long overdue for a Gordian Knot solution: take the fight to them, and make an example of them that the universe won't soon forget. This could finally quell our Directors' doubts, and prove to them that we who fight beneath EIC's banner are strong enough to prevail in any conflict, against any opponents! Give no quarter, take no prisoners, and destroy as many of the enemy as you can!]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_117001_eic"><![CDATA[No more pointless truces and shattered ceasefires! My instincts were correct, as usual - High Command has confirmed that we are to resume hostilities with, er, everyone.

The Lordak were the first to take the bait, so they'll be the first to die.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_117003_eic"><![CDATA[The marauders deduced that we're trying to capture them. They struck back by ever-so-generously donating our fleets' positions and strength to various aliens, in a sector-wide broadcast... I abhor empty charity. The first to take the bait were these incoming Lordaki, so it's appropriate that they be the first to die.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_117003_vru"><![CDATA[The marauders have deduced that we're attacking with intent to capture. Their response was in the form of a sector-wide broadcast to all unoccupied xenos, containing our fleets' positions and relative strengths. It's smart, I'll give them that. The inbound Lordaki on my screen are the first to take advantage.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_117004_eic"><![CDATA[Mordons heard the marauder broadcast, as well, so that makes them second up against the wall. And any damage they or the Lordaki have done will be taken out of marauder hides with punitive interest, believe you me - they're our primary concern while our troops are occupied on the front lines.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_117004_vru"><![CDATA[Second to get crossed off the list are some large-ish Mordons; they also heard the marauder broadcast.

We may be able to take 'em on just fine, but seems they cause other bugs real trouble. These marauders are startin' to worry me. They're too smart, and too good at using our enemies against us.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_117005_eic"><![CDATA[With this many Kristallon on their tails, no wonder those first two batches of aliens arrived so quickly after the broadcast! I'm beginning to grow deeply concerned. These marauders are too clever, respond too quickly, and are too good at using our enemies against us. I've never seen aliens who think like this.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_117005_vru"><![CDATA[Now we see why those first two xeno waves got here so soon after that broadcast - there were Kristallon right on their tails! These marauders think like no other xeno I've ever studied, or heard of... They're too smart, too fast, and too clever at using our enemies against us. I'm getting a little worried.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_117006_mmo"><![CDATA[Hate to admit it, but that broadcast was a pretty slick move. The series of coordinates all those aliens have followed sent them right past a Cubikon before they got to us, so they've been trailing a comet-tail of Protegit pains in our collective rears... But after that, my screen's pretty clear of bugs.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_117006_eic"><![CDATA[It pains me to admit what a tactically smart move that broadcast has turned out to be. The aliens received coordinates which sent them flying directly past a Cubikon before reaching us, which earned them a comet-tail of sorts of Protegits. Once they're shot down, my screen's clear of aliens for the foreseeable.]]></item>
 <item name="quest_description_117006_vru"><![CDATA[Credit where it's due: that broadcast was brilliant, strategically. The coordinates those xenos followed sent them flying past a Cubikon on their way here, activating its self-defenses and causing them to trail a sort of comet-tail of Protegits all the way here.

Once you've handled that, we're gonna rev this war machine up as high as she can go... We have a new directive: while our SecForce troops are handling most of the fighting, we'll flank the enemy and capture all the ore and materiel we can from both EIC and VRU.

 <item name="quest_description_417001_eic"><![CDATA[There's a spot of alien activity in our back yard - but once you've dealt with that, High Command has agreed to try and recruit the marauders as allies. It will require observation and data collection, and we'll also likely need ore for bribes. One can usually sway a savage's opinion with something shiny. No need to use our own ore, of course! Get it off our foes. It's a bit of a desperate gamble, but if we're going to survive going up against the MMO war machine, it may take a shot this long.]]></item>

We'll continue with the shows of strength, and prove we're valuable military allies - we'll have to hide the extent of our losses on the front lines, of course.

 <item name="quest_description_118019_eic"><![CDATA[MMO and VRU both have deep-space HQs that we have thus far shamefully overlooked and neglected.

Off you go, Scorpions!]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_118020_eic"><![CDATA[Ever since war broke out, we've been evacuating non-essential personnel from colonies and outposts near the front lines.

Establishing marauder vassal states will ensure that our armies will never lack cannon fodder.]]></item>

 <item name="quest_description_514006"><![CDATA[This new miners-and-refiner's union is throwing its weight around, and claims that the Battle Maps are still too dangerous to send ore refining fleets to work them.
